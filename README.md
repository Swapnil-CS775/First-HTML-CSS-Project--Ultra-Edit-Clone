# First HTML-CSS Project - Ultra Edit Clone

This project is a clone of the **UltraEdit** webpage, built using **HTML** and **CSS**. The goal of this project was to practice front-end web development by recreating the design and structure of a real-world application interface.

This project helped me practice and reinforce key front-end web development concepts, though the site is not fully responsive since this is my first project.

## Concepts I Learned:

1. **Flexbox and Grid Layouts**  
   I used **CSS Flexbox** for arranging items in the navigation bar and various sections of the webpage. Additionally, I applied **CSS Grid** to organize content in a structured manner, though more work is needed for full responsiveness.

2. **Navigation Bar Styling**  
   I designed a basic navigation bar with hover effects and dropdown icons. While itâ€™s not fully optimized for mobile, it was a great introduction to building interactive navigation elements.

3. **Button and Link Styling**  
   I learned how to style buttons and links using hover effects, ensuring they are visually appealing and functional.

4. **Font and Icon Integration**  
   I integrated custom fonts via **Google Fonts** and added icons using **Font Awesome** to give the site a polished and modern look.


This project was delayed due to unexpected technical issues and the loss of backups, requiring me to redo parts of the design and structure. Despite the setbacks, I was able to complete the project and gain valuable experience.
